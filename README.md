# UdacityCpp-FinalProject
# Implement a Set using hash based chain implementation (each bucket contains multiple elements)
##Set has following methods:
###Add: add element to the bucket and if the elements exists it will duplicate element in next bucket
###Remove: if the element is present it will remove from the set bucket 
###Contains: if the element is in present in the bucket it will return true else it returns false
###Union: union add two sets and return a resultant set. It will add only one instance of each element
###Intersection: add common elements of resultant set. It will add only one instance of each element
### Difference: It tries to find the elements present in A alone and remove the elements present in B.

| The submission must compile and Run                                           | we strongly recommend cmake and make as provided in the starter repos.If you choose another build system, the code must compile on any reviewer platform. | True       |
| The project demonstrates understanding of c++ function and control structures | A variety of control structures are used in the project.The project code is clearly organized into functions.                                             | True       |
| The project uses object oriented programming techniques.                      | The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data and class methods to perform tasks.                                     | True       |
| Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.                  | All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected and private.                                                                         | True          |
| Templates generalize functions in the project.                                | One function is declared with the template that allows it to accept a generic parameter.                                                                  | True          |                                  |                     |            |
